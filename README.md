This is a health & fitness website which specialize in tracking your fitness activities. The website provides fitness programs,fitness tracking dashboard and fitness related memberships .

In this project i have tried to manipulate dom elements, styling using css and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With my efforts and the technology stack that i have learned till Unit-4 in the Masai School, i am able to design the whole website with some functionalities & features.


# Technology Stack Used ðŸŒŸ
* React.js
